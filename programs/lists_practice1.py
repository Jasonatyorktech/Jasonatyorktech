#A varaible that holds more than one value is a list.
groceries=['bread','milk','eggs','cheese']
#you can get items from a list by their index
print(groceries[0])

#start an empty list
cart=[]
#for every item in my grocery list:
#Add that item to my cart


for item in groceries:
    cart.append(item)
print(cart)
